# Network addresses for VPNs

This repository has a working list of hostnames and IP addresses for VPNs.

IP addresses include those for:

* 1clickvpn.net
* Cyber Ghost VPN
* NordVPN
* ProtonVPN
* Windscribe

The hostnames include many other VPNs and proxies.

The output is two lists

* All hostnames
* IP addresses only for the server actually serving as VPN to avoid blocking a site, such as the homepage, billing system, or support site, which may be on a shared host with non-VPN sites

For thorough blocking VPNs, use the first list to block hostname resolution the DNS server, and use the second list in the router to reject packets based on IP address.
