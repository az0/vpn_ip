# This file is read by prepare_final_lists.py and resolved to IP addresses
# which are added to the allowlist, so these IP addresses will not be added
# to the output list of IP addresses.
#
# An illustrative example is that ProtonVPN sells swag at shop.proton.me,
# which is hosted by Shopify, but many non-VPN related websites also sell
# on Shopify using the same IP addresses, so this mechanism avoids blocking
# access to the non-VPN Shopify sites.
