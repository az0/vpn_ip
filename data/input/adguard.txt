# These are rules that match many of the fully-qualified domain names
# in the other files, and this list compresses a hostname list
# for Adguard.
#
# The Adbguard list will contain any FQDN from the other files that
# does not match a rule here.
#
# Only a minimal subset of Adguard rules are supported.
